# TOPICS FOR WEEK_01 CLASS

## 1. Introcutory concepts about C++

* C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

* It was creted as an extension of ***C Language***

* It's a multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.

* C++ is able to suport low-level, system-level programming -> Suitable to build OS and drivers
* C++ is  provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming -> Suitable to build desktop aplications, video games, ... 
* Best known for:
  * Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects.
  * Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.
  * Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.
  * Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.
