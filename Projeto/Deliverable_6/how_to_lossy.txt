How to implement the lossy codec:
Quantize the frame independently in every Y, U and V channel
Each Channel has a specific number of possible colours and instead of being 255, they will be 2^n, with n being the chosen quantitizer parameter for each specific channel.

So: we quantize the frame, leading to many of the difference Matrices to be just arrays of zeroes.
We then work as normal and decode the frame as normal.


If there is time, we should implement a way of telling the decoder to skip reading differnece frames of just zeroes, probably by inserting an extra bit to tell it that the difference matrice is just zeroes.
With this we can avoid coding matrices of zeroes, at the cost of an extra bit per matrix.

If possible, test if this is worth it, if not, include as "possible future improvements" in the report.
