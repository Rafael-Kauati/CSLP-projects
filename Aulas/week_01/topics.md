# TOPICS FOR WEEK_01 CLASS

## 1. Introcutory concepts about C++

* C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

* It was creted as an extension of ***C Language***

* It's a multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.

* C++ is able to suport low-level, system-level programming -> Suitable to build OS and drivers
* C++ is  provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming -> Suitable to build desktop aplications, video games, ... 
* Best known for:
  * Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects.
  * Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.
  * Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.
  * Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.

#### Data Types

|Data Type |	Meaning | Size (in Bytes) | 
|---|---|---|
|int | Integer | 4 |
|float | Floating-point | 4 |
|double | Double Floating-point | 8 |
|char | Character | 1 |
|wchar_t | Wide Character | 2 |
|bool | Boolean | 1 |
|void | Empty | 0 |

## 2. Standart Template Library (STL)



## 3. Introduction to Classes


* ### Objects vs Classes
  

* ### Constructors & Destructors


## 4.  Procedural paradigm

### Can be defined by these concepts : 

* Pre-defined Functions

* Local Variable

* Global Variable

* Parameter Passing

* Modularity

* Top-Down Approach

* High-level of abstraction

* Highly suitable for parallel programming

* Function/Variables are the primary progamming tools


## 5. Object-Oriented Programming paradigm

### Can be defined by these concepts : 

* Classes instantiated as objects

* Inheritance

* Polymorphism

* Modularity

* Encapsulation (data security) 

* High-level of abstraction

* Not suitable for parallel programming

* Classes/Objects are the primary progamming tools


## 6. Logic Programming paradigm 

### Can be defined by these concepts :  

* Based on Logical  Rules

* Automatic Inference

* Non-Determinism

* Recursion

* Pattern Matching


## 7. Functional Programming paradigm 

### Can be defined by these concepts :

*  First-Class and Higher-Order Functions

* Immutability

*  Pure Functions:

* Recursion

* Declarative Style
